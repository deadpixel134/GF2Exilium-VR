An unofficial mod for playing GF2 Exilium in VR.

**[Download release 1.1.2](https://github.com/deadpixel134/GF2Exilium-VR/releases/tag/v1.1.2)**

> **Required before using VR: Turn OFF anti-aliasing in the game's settings.**

## Choose Clean or Dirty

| Feature | Clean | Dirty |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary VR, stereo, controller input and settings | Included | Included |
| White spheres at both hand positions | Included | Included |
| Character breast contact and deformation | Excluded | Included |

Both variants share ordinary VR source, versions and updates. Only Dirty includes contact deformation code; Clean excludes that implementation rather than merely turning it off.

- [GF2VR-Native-SelfContained-Dirty-1.1.2.zip](https://github.com/deadpixel134/GF2Exilium-VR/releases/tag/v1.1.2)

Install one variant at a time. Both use the same single version.dll beside the game executable; shared support files, including the OpenXR loader and Configurator, are installed under vrmod. Original GameAssembly.dll, UnityPlayer.dll and game assets are not replaced. Both variants run inside the game process; the name Clean does not guarantee nondetection or safety.

## Install, switch and remove

1. Fully extract the desired Clean or Dirty ZIP into a fresh folder. GitHub Source code archives are not installers.
2. Close the game, Configurator and Installer. Run GF2VR.Installer.exe from the new folder and select GF2_Exilium.exe or the game folder. The bundled package is found automatically.
3. Confirm the variant and version, then install. To switch Clean↔Dirty, use the Installer from the desired ZIP.
4. Open Settings, save, and start the game through your normal route. Hand spheres default to enabled and can be changed in the Hands tab.

Installation, switching and removal preserve user settings. Optional touch_interaction.json is used only by Dirty. Remove restores a recorded previous installation when available; otherwise it removes only owned files. Modified or unowned DLLs are preserved and refused. Do not copy version.dll alone or mix files from different packages.

## Verification and limits

Previously tested setup: Meta Quest 2 · 4K monitor · Virtual Desktop.

Binocular misalignment reported on Quest 3 and Galaxy XR remains unresolved. Galaxy XR reports cover both VDXR and SteamVR. Version 1.1.2 updates Installer/documentation guidance; its VR DLLs and Configurator are unchanged from 1.1.1. Adding the instruction to disable anti-aliasing does not establish that either headset report is fixed.
