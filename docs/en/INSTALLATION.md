## 1.1.5 — Logging controls

Added **Diagnostics → Automatically record logs** to the settings GUI in both Clean and Dirty. The default is **OFF**, including when older settings omit this option. Save and restart the game to apply.

On the first update installation, previous automatic VR logs are cleaned once for users with logging OFF. **Users with logging ON keep their existing logs and are excluded from this initial cleanup.** Switching OFF later does not trigger a deferred deletion. Settings, other mods and manually collected evidence are preserved.

Enable logging when troubleshooting. With logging ON, the same build log is appended and may grow over time.

For 1.1.5, extract the entire desired Clean or Dirty ZIP into a new folder and use its new GF2VR.Installer.exe. Older settings programs may reject the new native profile. Existing settings are preserved.

## 1.1.4

Updating to 1.1.4: extract the entire Clean or Dirty ZIP into a new folder and install with its GF2VR.Installer.exe at your existing game location. The old 1.1.3 Configurator cannot validate the new native profile, so use the installer from the new ZIP for this update. Existing settings are preserved. Do not copy only the DLL or mix package files.

Both builds provide auxiliary-panel viewer-facing, position, rotation, screen tilt and maximum-size settings. Dirty adds character-contact vibration and separate breast/buttock jiggle settings.


> **Required before using VR: Turn OFF anti-aliasing in the game's settings.**

Updating to 1.1.3: extract the complete Clean or Dirty ZIP into a new folder and use its GF2VR.Installer.exe with your existing game location. The old 1.1.2 Configurator rejects automatic staging because it cannot validate the new native profile, preserving the current installation. Do not copy only the DLL or mix package files.

1.1.3 delivers the default-wrapper 3DMigoto interoperability changes from PR #1 in both Clean and Dirty. Game wrappers remain intact; VR copies and OpenXR use the native D3D11 device/context. Matching Configurator and Installer metadata ships with the DLLs.

| Feature | Clean | Dirty |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary VR, stereo, controller input and settings | Included | Included |
| White spheres at both hand positions | Included | Included |
| Character breast contact and deformation | Excluded | Included |

1. Fully extract the desired Clean or Dirty ZIP into a fresh folder. GitHub Source code archives are not installers.
2. Close the game, Configurator and Installer. Run GF2VR.Installer.exe from the new folder and select GF2_Exilium.exe or the game folder. The bundled package is found automatically.
3. Confirm the variant and version, then install. To switch Clean↔Dirty, use the Installer from the desired ZIP.
4. Open Settings, save, and start the game through your normal route. Hand spheres default to enabled and can be changed in the Hands tab.

Install one variant at a time. Both use the same single version.dll beside the game executable; shared support files, including the OpenXR loader and Configurator, are installed under vrmod. Original GameAssembly.dll, UnityPlayer.dll and game assets are not replaced. Both variants run inside the game process; the name Clean does not guarantee nondetection or safety.

Installation, switching and removal preserve user settings. Optional touch_interaction.json is used only by Dirty. Remove restores a recorded previous installation when available; otherwise it removes only owned files. Modified or unowned DLLs are preserved and refused. Do not copy version.dll alone or mix files from different packages.

The reported binocular misalignment on Quest 3 and Galaxy XR was confirmed to be caused by anti-aliasing. Turn OFF anti-aliasing in the game's settings before using VR.
